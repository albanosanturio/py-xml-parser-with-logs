# py-xml-parser-with-logs

#### Priorities:
1.Add a sort by OPCO** functionality. (Need a SAP extract)
2.Only process ids included in a "approved meters id" list (Need that file format)
3.Removing unnecesary meters from being processed (ids starting with "600")
4.Find any other efficiencies

#### Extra:
Repo
Config file
Requirements

#### Follow up questions:
Is info from "SAP Extract by opco" and "Approved meters id" redundant?
Should we filter by both?
Both previous info... Format? Size? Frequency? Will it get to be a huge file over time? Does it accumulate?
Difference in NY and CMP codes?
Any other difference that comes with opco?
Ask Steve adams for sample info about: Approved meters_id && SAP extract by OPCO

#### Currently WIP:
Setting environment locally and making the test runs work same as bryan
